# Project Setup and Testing

## Testing:

### Locally

- Run playmode from `ConnectionScene`.
- Open Virtual players from `Window` -> `MultiPlayer` -> `MultiPlayer Play mode`.

### Multiple devices

- Get Host's IP from `cmd` using `-ipconfig` (should be something like `192.168.68.xxx`). Put this IP address for both host and client Connection Address.
- Make sure to open the necessary port in your firewall.
